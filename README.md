Pressure-volume (PV) loopsÂ are the gold standard for measuring direct, real-time cardiac function which gives lot of information regarding underlying cardiac diseases
To create GUI of cardiovascular system and estimate the sensitive parameters necessary to predict the PV loop 
To visualize the relationship between inputs and outputs
